<p>As a postdoctoral associate at the Center for Neural Science at NYU, I am part of <a href="https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/j-anthony-movshon.html"> Tony Movshon's</a> laboratory. I combine behavioral and neurophysiological measurements with systems modeling to study fundamental questions in primate visual processing. I also use measurements of visual system function to two practical ends. First, to model the origin of extracellular field potentials recorded using surface electrocorticography (ECoG) over the visual cortex to optimize the design of ECoG arrays for clinical applications. Second, to understand the etiology of amblyopia, a visual disorder of the central nervous system. I collaborate with a large team of experimentalists and theorists across various disciplines. </p>

<p>I received my PhD from the Department of Neurobiology at Duke University's School of Medicine, where I worked with <a href="//www.neuro.duke.edu/research/faculty-labs/lisberger-lab"> Stephen Lisberger</a>
(Department of Neurobiology) and <a href="//sommerlab.pratt.duke.edu"> Marc Sommer</a> (Department of Biomedical Engineering) to study and model the roles of different sites of the cerebellum in the planning and control of eye movements.</p>
