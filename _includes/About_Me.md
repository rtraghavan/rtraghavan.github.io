I am an AI engineer focused on machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. I develop intelligent systems that analyze and interpret complex multimodal data, emphasizing the creation of compound AI systems designed for injury prevention.


Previously, I served as a postdoctoral associate at the Center for Neural Science at NYU, working in Tony Movshon's laboratory. My research blended behavioral and neurophysiological measurements with computational modeling to understand motion and scene perception. I also led projects to optimize clinical ECoG (electrocorticography) array development and investigated the neural basis of amblyopia.

I earned my PhD from the Department of Neurobiology at Duke University, where I worked with Stephen Lisberger and Marc Sommer to study the cerebellum's role in planning and controlling eye movements and with Miguel Nicolelis and Mikhaeil Lebedev to study motor learning and brain-machine interfaces.
