<p>I am a postdoctoral associate in the Center for Neural Science at NYU working in the laboratory of <a href="https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/j-anthony-movshon.html"> Tony Movshon.</a> My current research employs psychophysical, physiological, and computational methods to study early visual processing from the retina to the extrastriate cortex.</p>

<p>I did my PhD in the Department of Neurobiology at Duke University with <a href="//www.neuro.duke.edu/research/faculty-labs/lisberger-lab"> Stephen Lisberger</a> and
<a href="//sommerlab.pratt.duke.edu"> Marc Sommer</a> studying the roles of different sites of the cerebellum in the planning and control of eye movements.</p>
