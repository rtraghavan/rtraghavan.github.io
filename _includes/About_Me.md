<p>As a postdoctoral associate at the Center for Neural Science at NYU, I am part of <a href="https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/j-anthony-movshon.html"> Tony Movshon's laboratory </a>. I combine behavioral and neurophysiological measurements with systems modeling to study fundamental questions in primate visual processing. I also use measurements of visual system function to two practical ends. First, to model the origin of extracellular field potentials recorded using surface electrocorticography (ECoG) over the visual cortex to optimize the design of ECoG arrays for clinical applications. Second, to understand the etiology of amblyopia, a visual disorder of the central nervous system. I collaborate with a large team of experimentalists and theorists across various disciplines. </p>

<p>I did my PhD in the Department of Neurobiology at Duke University with <a href="//www.neuro.duke.edu/research/faculty-labs/lisberger-lab"> Stephen Lisberger</a> and
<a href="//sommerlab.pratt.duke.edu"> Marc Sommer</a> studying the roles of different sites of the cerebellum in the planning and control of eye movements.</p>
