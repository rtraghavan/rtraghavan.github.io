<p>I am a postdoctoral associate in the Center for Neural Science at NYU carrying out research in the laboratory of <a href="//www.cns.nyu.edu/corefaculty/Movshon.php"> Tony Movshon.</a>
My research employs physiological and computational methods to study early visual processing.
  
I did my PhD in the Department of Neurobiology at Duke University in the laboratories of <a href="//www.neuro.duke.edu/research/faculty-labs/lisberger-lab"> Stephen G. Lisberger</a> and
<a href="//sommerlab.pratt.duke.edu"> Marc A. Sommer</a> where I studied the role of different sites of the cerebellum in the control of smooth pursuit and saccadic eye movements.</p>
