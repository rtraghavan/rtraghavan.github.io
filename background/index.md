title: My Background
---

<h3 class="bio-section">Early Training</h3>

<p>My training started with a PhD in Neurobiology at Duke University. I studied how the cerebellum, the part of the brain involved in motor control, plans and controls eye movements under the mentorship of Stephen Lisberger and Marc Sommer.</p>

<p>This work sparked my interest in control theory and systems identification—the use of mathematical models to describe how feedback systems operate. These ideas still shape my thinking.</p>

<h3 class="bio-section">Postdoctoral Research</h3>

<p>As a postdoc at NYU's Center for Neural Science in Tony Movshon's lab, I shifted to computational vision. I combined behavioral and neurophysiological methods with computer vision tools to investigate how the brain encodes and decodes visual information.</p>

<p>Leading translational projects with clinical ECoG arrays introduced me to real-world, imperfect settings.</p>

<h3 class="bio-section">Current Approach</h3>

<p>I continue to approach applied AI and computer vision systems as a psychologist would study perception. I see them as parts of a broader cognitive architecture of memory, reasoning, and decision-making under uncertainty.</p>

<p>Working in safety-critical environments constantly reminds me of the gap between idealized models and reality. This reinforces my need to move between theory and practice.</p>

<p class="bio-continuation">For that reason, I contribute to open-source implementations of psychological, visual, and—more recently—risk models. Writing software is a way for me to formalize assumptions, interrogate their limits, and carry insights from theoretical work back into deployed systems. It also provides a concrete mechanism for refining reasoning through implementation.</p>
