## Welcome to Personal Webpage of Ramanujan Raghavan

I based my page on the sourcecode at https://github.com/oliviaguest/oliviaguest.github.io 
It has been heavily edited, feel free to use it to structure your own page if you see fit. 

### Markdown
I'm keeping the markdown syntax that came with the original README file, I find it useful

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```
